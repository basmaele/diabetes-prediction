# Diabetes prediction - End-to-End ML Project

This project implements a simple machine learning pipeline to predict the risk of diabetes based on clinical and demographic features. Using a publicly available dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iammustafatz/diabetes-prediction-dataset), the project covers data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and model persistence following a clean and modular Python project structure.
